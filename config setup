config setup

for global theme for qt applications you need qt5ct and in the file /etc/enviroment you need the following command:
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

then linux updates this command might get overwritten so you also need a override file /etc/enviroment.d/qt5ct.conf with:
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

for gtk applications you can just install either nwg-look or lxappearance
